                                    I interned at Bluemoon Ethiopia working on the gebeya.net platform back in the summer of 2017. It was a project that aimed to modernize the transaction between local farmers in rural areas and customers in other cities all over Ethiopia.

                                    I'm currently working as part of a media team, mainly overlooking video edits and content creation, at Thrive. Thrive is a Young Adults ministry that focuses on helping the youth grow spiritually. It's a very recent position which I hope to get a lot of video editing and leadership experiences.

                           <h3>Volunteering</h3>
                           <p>
                               I like working in teams and helping people, so I've tried to participate in a couple of volunteering programs. 
                               <ul>
                                   <li>
                                       <strong>YWCA (Young Women's and Children's Association)</strong>
                                       I volunteered there after I finished 10th grade (2016). I had a lot of fun and managed to help a lot of kids in elementary school, better understand their subjects. Math and English mainly. I also made a lot of friends and matured a lot, along the way.
                                   </li>
                                   <li>
                                        <strong>Red Cross</strong> I managed to volunteer here for a couple of weeks in 2016. I helped organize a lot of papers and also called previous blood donors to remind them to come and donate blood again.
                                   </li>
                                   <li>
                                       <strong>Youth for Christ</strong> I volunteered at this organization last year (2019). It's an organization that imports books fron donors outside Ethiopia and tries to set up libraries all over the country. It also organizes fun and educating summer programs for elementary and high school kids.
                                   </li>
